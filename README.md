# Domain-Generality and Domain-Specific Metacognition in the _Confidence Database_

These files accompany the presentation _"Scant Evidence for Domain-General Metacognition"_ by Saurish Srivastava and Jorge Morales of the [Subjectivity Lab](https://subjectivity.sites.northeastern.edu/) at the [OPAM 2022 Conference](opam.net) in Boston, MA.

Datasets were retrieved from the open-source [Confidence Database](https://osf.io/s46pr/) along with its [accompanying paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0813-1).

**Note:** [`/Confidence Database`](https://github.com/subjectivitylab/domain-generality/tree/main/Confidence%20Database) does not contain _all_ datasets. To keep this repository small, only multi-domain studies have been added to run [`/scripts/mle`](https://github.com/subjectivitylab/domain-generality/tree/main/scripts/mle) and [`/scripts/hmetad`](https://github.com/subjectivitylab/domain-generality/tree/main/scripts/hmetad). To run a full-database analysis as in [`/scripts/full`](https://github.com/subjectivitylab/domain-generality/tree/main/scripts/full), download the entire dataset from the above link and add those files into the respective folder.

All analyses have been conducted in `Python >=3.8` using [MetadPy](https://github.com/embodied-computation-group/metadPy).
